# 1.5 Java Language Exercises
This repository contains several Java exercises that demonstrate basic file operations, directory manipulation, and serialization. Each exercise is organized into its own directory, and the goal is to teach fundamental Java concepts such as working with files, directories, recursion, and serialization.

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or later installed on your machine.
- Git to clone this repository.
- An IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code) or a terminal to run the Java code.

## Exercise 1: Directory Lister

### Description
This exercise contains a Java class that lists the contents of a specified directory in alphabetical order.

### How to Run
- The program accepts a directory path as a parameter and prints the files and directories in the specified path in alphabetical order.


## Exercise 2: Directory Lister

### Description
This program lists the contents of a directory and its subdirectories recursively. It also prints whether each item is a file or a directory, along with the last modified date.
### How to Run
The program accepts a directory path as a parameter and prints the directory structure, including subdirectories, in a tree format.

## Exercise 3: Directory Tree Save

### Description
This exercise saves the output from Exercise 2 into a text file, instead of printing it to the console.
### How to Run
The program accepts a directory path and an output file path as parameters and saves the directory structure to the file.


## Exercise 4: File Reader

### Description
This program reads the contents of a specified .txt file and prints it to the console.
### How to Run
The program accepts a file path as a parameter and prints the contents of the file to the console.



## Exercise 5: Object Serialization

### Description
This exercise demonstrates object serialization and deserialization. It serializes a Java object to a .ser file and then deserializes it back.

### How to Run
The program creates an object, serializes it to a file, and then deserializes it back into an object.
